# Main Effect Prior
Code for "Improving Neural Networks for Genotype-Phenotype Prediction Using Published Summary Statistics". We design an informative regularization method for machine learning algorithms, such as neural networks, which incorporates prior knowledge about the genotype main effect from public GWAS summary statistics into training.

#### Toy example on simulated data by running demo.ipynb
Note:
1. Training and testing data are in the "/data" folder;
2. Joint effect of SNPs are stored in the "/summary_statistics" folder.
