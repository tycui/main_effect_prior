# Main Effect Prior
Code for "Improving Neural Networks for Genotype-Phenotype Prediction Using Published Summary Statistics". We design an informative regularization method for machine learning algorithms, such as neural networks, which can encode the prior knowledge of main effects from public GWAS summary statistics.
